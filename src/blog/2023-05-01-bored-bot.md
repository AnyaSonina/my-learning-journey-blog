Welcome to the "Bored Bot" project. It was a small but fun project, in which a teacher introduced APIs.

I enjoyed it so much. APIs allow us to build more interesting and complex apps by providing access to real data and even pre-written code. I'm excited and just looking forward to more advanced projects with APIs.

**How I enhanced it**

1. I set a nice background image (The background image is really the rock star of the project).

I made it responsive with the following code:

And I also provided a smaller size version for smaller screens.

2. I created @keyframes rule for the h3 element, which I dynamically applied through JavaScript. 
3. I dynamically changed the border-box property on the button click. I found outstanding box shadows at <https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples>
4. I found a nice icon for the button at <https://fontawesome.com/>

There's not much to it, but I believe that anything that can be improved should be improved :)
