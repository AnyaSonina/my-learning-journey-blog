What I learned:

During this block of lectures I learned about:

\- Google fonts and how to embed them 

\- background images and how to manipulate them in CSS

\- WebP format, which provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web.

\- Span tag, which is similar to a div, but is an inline element primarily used for styling purposes.

\- id attribute and its uniqueness in the document (there can't be 2 elements with the same ids)

\- text-shadow (I also learned a cool trick on how to make a text stand out from a background if they have similar style and color:  text-shadow: 0 0 5 black;)

Important takeaways:

Buttons don't inherit font-family. So it's important to use inheritance to style it properly.

To embed a custom font there is a font-face property. 

Websites that were used:

1001fonts.com - one of the great websites with plenty of custom fonts

giphy.com - background image in WebP format

<https://coolors.co> - palette generator 

An initial website made with a Scrimba teacher:

How I enhanced it:

1. I created this white block that makes a Call To Action section more attractive for a user.

In the process of creating it, I overcame an obstacle with a text losing opacity together with a changing white block opacity. I found a solution by making a white block positioned relative, while the text div is positioned absolutely.

2. I provided a different style for the elements of CTA section on hover.
3. I embedded a custom font.
4. I choose matching colors with the help of coolors palette generator. 
5. I changed border-radius on a button element.
6. I made the design of the hero section skewed to the left by using a clip-path generator. (<https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/>)
