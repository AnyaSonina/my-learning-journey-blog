Welcome to the "Quizzical" Solo project!

_**How did I build it?**_

I built it using npm create-react-app on VS Code and local server. The project consists of  4 components (Start, Questions, Footer and App). All the data props are passed to the components in accordance with the Single Source of Truth principle. 

In the App component, the questions and the answers are pulled from the OTDB API
