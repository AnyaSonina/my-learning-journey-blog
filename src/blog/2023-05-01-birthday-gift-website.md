What I learned:

\- align-items flexbox property

\- flex-direction

\- :hover pseudo-class

\- linear-gradient function 

\- grouping selector



Important takeaways:

When changing flex-direction to column, the main axis flips and becomes vertical, so justify-content and align-items change their direction, too.



Text-align centers only inline elements inside of its container, it doesn't center block elements. Block elements can be centered with a margin.



We can't set width and height on inline elements because they should always be the size of their content.





Websites that were used:

tota11y bookmarklet

https://coolors.co - palette generator 



https://cssgradient.io/



An initial website made with a Scrimba teacher:

Going above and beyond: 

\- Well, the main this is I personalized it and congratulated my husband. 

\- I got to know tota11ly contrast checker and it helped me immensely in improving the contrast ratio and reminded me about an alt attribute on images.

\- I animated gifs with transform property. 

\- I acknowledged myself with the transition property and used

 transition-property, transition-duration, and transition-timing-function using shorthand property.
