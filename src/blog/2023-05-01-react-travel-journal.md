Welcome to the "Travel Journal" React Solo project. The project was built on my own. It was one of the tasks in the "React Basics" module of Scrimba's "Frontend career path" course. 



How I built it



I created two components (Navbar.js and Card.js). I passed props to the Card component and filled it with the data received in props. After that, I composed those components in the App component. I mapped over the array of data and created several instances of the Card component, setting props to the data from the array and thus sending it to the Card component. 







What I learned:



How to pass props to components



How to map data



How to pass the props using spread object



How to make the card element of the same background color as the body stand out with box-shadow.



I enjoyed doing the project in React. Although the library is new for me and I'm only starting with it, I feel like a good knowledge of JS is helping me a lot. The whole concept of props sinks in when remembering parameters and arguments in JS.
