title: Digital business card
description: >-
  This was the project I created following Scrimba "Front-end career path". By
  making it I was practising the implementation of image alt text, flex child
  containers, inheritance, shorthands, web-safe fonts, color palettes. Look
  further to read how I made it my own.

Today I finished a business card project on Scrimba. A starting point was Per's Harold's business card:

My main goal was to personalize the card. 



What I did:



1. I created a more descriptive card structure by using <heading> and <footer> HTML5 tags.

2. I created 2 utility classes for margins for my code to be DRYer.

3. I went to coolors.co and checked the color's compatibility and found a better (to my taste) color for a border.

4. I learned about box-shadow on my own and added it to my card.

5. I animated it on hover. 

6. I added a gradient to the card and changed it on hover to add up an animation effect.

7. I deployed the card on Netlify.
