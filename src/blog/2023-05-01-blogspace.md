Welcome to the "BlogSpace" project. This was Scrimba's course project, which was devoted to the intro to APIs topic. Although it is a learning project, I managed to accomplish some stretch goals, learn something new, and make the project my own.

How I improved it

1. I added the option to delete a clicked post. I did it with a help of data attributes. 

2. I saved postsArray to local storage so that we can see the recently added posts, not only posts from API.



3. I styled it differently and learned some new selectors and properties. 



What did I learn:



1. The border-image-source property specifies the path to the image to be used as a border (instead of the normal border around an element).

2. The border-image-sliceÂ CSS property divides the image specified by border-image-source into regions. These regions form the components of an element's border image.



3. I fixed a style bug with the overflow-wrap:break-word; property. The newly submitted post won't behave responsively and won't shrink, so the property made it responsive.
